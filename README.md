# Enhance-Map-Image-Quality

Enhancing the quality of map images using Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SR-GAN) involves training a GAN model on a dataset of low-resolution and high-resolution map images. In this example, I'll provide you with a simplified implementation using Python and TensorFlow. Keep in mind that creating a fully functional SR-GAN model typically requires a large dataset, significant computational resources, and training time.

## Prerequisites:

You need to have Python and TensorFlow installed on your system. You can install TensorFlow via pip: pip install tensorflow.

1-  Data Preparation: You should have a dataset of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) map images.
2- Model Architecture: We'll create a Generator and a Discriminator for the GAN.
3- Loss Functions: The GAN uses adversarial and content loss.
4- Training Loop: Training the SR-GAN on the dataset.
5- Testing: Using the trained model to enhance the quality of map images.

### Note
It's essential to tune hyperparameters, experiment with different architectures, and save model checkpoints during training. The code provided is a simplified example, and you may need to make adjustments based on your specific use case and dataset.
